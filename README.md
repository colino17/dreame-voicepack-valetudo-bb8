## Notes on File Formats

These particular robots seem very sensitive to file formats, bitrates, etc. After banging my head against a wall for quite some time wondering why some of my sounds worked fine, but others didn't play at all, I stumbled across [this article](https://blog.davidv.dev/posts/spicing-up-a-robot-vacuum/) which detailed the specific ffmpeg encoding settings required.

Here's a small shell script for bulk converting audio files to the right format. Remember to create an "out" subfolder and change "wav" in the first line to whatever the extension of the source files is.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

for i in *.wav
do
  ffmpeg -i "$i" -ac 1 -ar 16000 "out/${i%.*}.ogg"
done
```
